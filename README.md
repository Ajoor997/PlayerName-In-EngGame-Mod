# PlayerName In EndGame kill List MOD
This is a mode that adds player Name in EndGame kill/losses section

The repo only includes the file changed in the making of this mod

Stem Mod Description: 
[h2] I. Description [/h2]
This mod is purely cosmetic as it does not change any game play elements. Therefore, you could use the mod in any multiplayer game without the need for others to have the mod. The mod adds the playerName for each unit in the kill/losses list to give you a better idea of which player has killed your unit.

Currently under test: It works perfectly fine, i have yet to spot any problems with the mod. 

I have not tested this mod on all monitor sizes, so if the organization of the line is messed up, please let me know of your screen resolution and how it looks like. 

[h2] II. Source Code [/h2]
